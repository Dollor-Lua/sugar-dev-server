# Sugar Development Server Template

A template server used by the Sugar Music Client to provide a fast development experience for all developers.

## Getting Started

Clone this github repository, and to initialize run:

```sh
$ npm install # if you use npm
$ yarn # if you use yarn
```

to initialize the packages. Then, you can start the server by running:

```sh
$ npm run start # if you use npm
$ yarn start # if you use yarn
```

This should start the development server. Head on over to http://localhost:3000/ or http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to test out your application! All modifications should automatically recompile, so don't worry about stopping the server. If your sass doesn't seem to update, give it around a second to recompile the bundle and then reload the page.
